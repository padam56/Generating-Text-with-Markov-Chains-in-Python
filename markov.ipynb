So, that's why the grammar is so poor. Any two consecutive words makes sense together but then the next word over might not have any relation to that pair. So, one thing we can do to improve the result is to redefine the meaning of state to include the current token and the previous token. Here, down below, any 3 consecutive words will be related to each other and have the right grammar instead of just every pair of words and that could improve the grammar dramatically. We are going to call this a 2-Token/Word Markov Chain, since our states has 2 words in it."
